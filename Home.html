            <p>Welcome to the home page of my project web site! I am using this project to detail my love of photography by displaying a few pictures from my travels over the last couple of years.<br> 
                I hope you enjoy viewing the photos as much as I enjoyed taking them.</br> </p></div>

        <h1><strong><div style= "color:dodgerblue">Behind The Camera</strong></h1></div>

<p>I have never desired to be in front of the camera, but rather behind. Capturing moments in time with family and friends, appreciating the beauty of nature, or snagging that rare photo opportunity are just a few of the reasons I love photography. I have included a link to my Smugmug account where I have made a few images public. <br> <a href='http://smugmug.com/' target='_blank'>Smugmug.</a> You can view more of my photos on Smugmug.</p></br>
