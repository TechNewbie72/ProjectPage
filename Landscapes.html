        <h1>Description</h1>

<p><b>Yellowstone National Park</b>
    <br>The funny story behind this picture is I waited 45 minutes to take the picture. Everytime I thought I had a shot, someone would walk through the picture or was nearby. In the end, it was worth the wait. It is one of my favorite pictures. <br>
    <br><b>Yellowstone Road</b><br>
    The funny story behind this pic is I was driving to another spot in the park and realized no one was coming down the road and there was this quick window to capture this photo. There was a dead silence for the 10 minutes I was out of the car and trying to find the perfect spot in the middle of the road. I have to say, this was the most breathtaking spot in my experience thus far. The air was clean, crisp and it felt very remote.<br>
    <br>The remaining pictures are from another visit to <b>Yosemite National Park</b> which is another one of my favorite spots. The other picture is from one my many drives along the <b>Pacific Coast Highway.</b>
